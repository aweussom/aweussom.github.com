Summary: Using the Pelican publishing system to create blog on github pages

Following the instructions here:
https://rsip22.github.io/blog/create-a-blog-with-pelican-and-github-pages.html
I now have a working blog.

The only addition was to create a python3 virtual environment, which was simple enough:
python3 -m venv /home/pi/pelican
source /home/pi/pelican/bin/activate
