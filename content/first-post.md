Summary: Using the Pelican publishing system to create blog on github pages

Following the instructions 
[on Renata's blog](https://rsip22.github.io/blog/create-a-blog-with-pelican-and-github-pages.html "Renata's blog")
I now have a working blog on Github Pages!


The only addition was to create a python3 virtual environment, which was simple enough:

	python3 -m venv /home/pi/pelican
	source /home/pi/pelican/bin/activate
